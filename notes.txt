Comp vision notes:
1. dlib + OpenCV allows for face classification + feature classification. See
https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html#gsc.tab=0
for a project that does eye detection. Can then measure angle + size of eyes to determine what to do with glasses

2. Alternatively, find face classification algorithm that measures head tilt some other way, perform rotation on the image
to frontalize it, then do Haar-like rectangles to find eyes. Scale glasses and place them, and then rotate glasses and image
back to original orientation



Haar cascade vs deepnet solution:
 -- for detecting eyes and faces, will want to test differences between haar cascade and deepnet

  - The command to connect: ssh -i ryan-computer-vision-key.pem ubuntu@ec2-52-55-242-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  - To do SCP: scp -i ryan-computer-vision-key.pem file_here ubuntu@ec2-52-55-242-160.compute-1.amazonaws.com:destination_here

Questions to ask:
 - Would it be reasonable to compare a Haar Cascade classifier vs CNN classifier on faces and eyes and see which one does better?
 - Followup: What's the standard way to measure accuracy in this case? Would it be a simple testing accuracy on face vs. non-face images?
   How about testing on images with multiple faces on it? (or should i not do this)
 - Should i be adhering to certain image dimensions when training the classifier? I've seen make negative images 100x100 and faces 50x50,
   but unsure how reliable/important this is
 - 

 Manually place eyes on set of like 20 images, don't use images in training set
 Test each classifier on the perfect images, create some sort of distance function (distance from centers)
 (intersection/union of bounding boxes -- IOU)


Game plan:
 - Use both the Haar cascade and CNN tensorflow out-of-box solutions to find eyes. Test which one is more accurate (somehow)
   - while it's accepted that CNNs are usually better nowadays, are their bounding boxes more accurate, or just the rate at which they recognize?
   - In review: mention that generally known that CNNs are more accurate for object detection, but question the accuracy of the detection? Can a Haar Cascade detector locate eyes more accurately than a CNN?
 - Take the better method and use it to place the glasses. Measure this against a small set of 20 images that are perfectly labelled.

Glasses:
 Regular: Width 600px, height 205px. 76px from top of image to bottom of nose frame
 Sunglasses: Width 600px, height 209px


Interesting assumption: head always taller than wider?
